# Summary


# Statement of need

- Detection of ground points is a necessary precursor step for extraction of useful information from pointcloud data for downstream tasks in mobile robot navigation [6,8]
- Object and obstacle detection algorithms detect ground points as false positives. The detection can be improved when ground points are
detected and removed. Additionally, the computational burden is reduced by processing only non-ground points.
- Ground points can be used for traversability analysis, navigation, and static map generation.
